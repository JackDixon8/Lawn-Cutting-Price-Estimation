#Lawn-Cutting-Price-Estimation
The Lawn Price Calculator GUI is a comprehensive tool that calculates and estimates the cost of lawn cutting services. It takes into account various factors such as distance from the lawn cutting business, shape of the lawn, length, and width.

The user-friendly interface allows for easy input of relevant information, and the program utilizes advanced algorithms to accurately calculate the estimated cost. The estimation is based on a rate of $0.1 per square foot, with an additional charge for distance in kilometers at a rate of $0.5 per kilometer.

Please note that at this moment, the Circle feature in the GUI is not functioning properly. 

This program has been developed using the Python programming language, and utilizes the Tkinter library for the GUI design, and the Geodesic library for distance estimation based on address. With its robust and reliable code, this program is a valuable asset for any lawn cutting business.
