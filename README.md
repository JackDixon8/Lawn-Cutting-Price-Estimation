Lawn-Cutting-Price-Estimation

The Lawn Price Calculator GUI is a comprehensive tool that calculates and estimates the cost of lawn cutting services. It takes into account various factors such as distance from the lawn cutting business, shape of the lawn, length, and width.

The estimation is based on a rate of $0.1 per square foot, with an additional charge for distance in kilometers at a rate of $0.5 per kilometer.

Please note that at this moment, the Circle feature in the GUI is not functioning properly. 

This program has been developed using Python, and utilizes the Tkinter library for the GUI design, and the Geodesic library for distance estimation based on address.
